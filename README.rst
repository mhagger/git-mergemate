**This project has been renamed**

git-mergemate is the original name of `git-imerge`_.  Its history has
been incorporated into that project and git-mergemate is no longer
under development.

Please see the `git-imerge`_ project for a much more capable successor
to this tool.

(If you *really* want to see the old git-mergemate history, it is
still here, under branch "archive".)
